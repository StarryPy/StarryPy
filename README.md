# StarryPy

StarryPy is Twisted-based plugin-driven Starbound server wrapper. It is currently in beta.

## Features

With the built-in plugins (which are removable):
* User management. Kicking, banning, whois, player listing. Multiple user levels.
* Message of the day
* Build protection by user level.
* Warping.
* Give item.
* Starter items for new players.
* Join/quit announcements.
* And more.

## Installation

StarryPy runs on Python 2.7. It has been tested with Python 2.7.6, 2.7.5, 2.7.2,
and PyPy.

This requires Python and pip to install, and on *nix systems the python
development headers (python-dev in apt, python-devel in yum.) After installing
those, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of
StarryPy. This will install all of the components needed for use. I recommend
running it in a virtualenv.

Create a configuration file using the config.json.example. The most important
things to note are owner\_uuid, which should be set to a character's UUID that
you possess and have never shared; server\_address and server\_port, which
should be set to the proxied server. StarryPy will default to port 21025 for
normal clients to connect to. Select a good random port, or set it to 21024 and
firewall it off from the outside.

## Run it

After making sure the Starbound server is running, use your terminal (cmd or
powershell on windows) and `cd` to the directory you installed StarryPy into.
Enter `python server.py` to start the proxy.

## Built-in plugins

StarryPy is nearly entirely plugin driven (our plugin manager is a plugin!), so
there are quite a few built-in plugins. The truly important plugins are in the
`core\_plugins` folder. If you remove any of those, it's likely that most other
plugins will break. We'll break them down by core plugin and normal plugin
classes. If you are looking for the commands, feel free to skip the core plugins
section.

### Core Plugins

Core plugins are plugins that have no dependencies and are intended to be
accessed by other plugins. If your plugin doesn't meet those criteria, it is
recommended to put it in the normal plugins folder.

#### Player Manager

The player manager is perhaps the most essential plugin of them all. It keeps
track of each player that logs in, tracks their position, and manages
kicks/bans. It is composed of the actual database manager, using SQLAlchemy on
an SQLite3 backend by default.

#### Command Plugin

This is a core plugin that works in conjunction with the plugin class
SimpleCommandPlugin. SimpleCommandPlugins automatically register their commands
with the instantiated command plugin and when a chat packet is sent it is
automatically parsed. If it matches one of these commands, it sends it off to
that function for processing. If it doesn't match any of the commands, it sends
it on its merry way to the actual starbound server for processing.

### Plugins

#### Admin Commands

The admin commands plugin implements player management from in game. It is a
SimpleCommandPlugin that provides the following commands:

* **/who**: Displays all users currently logged into the server. `Access: Everyone`
* **/planet**: Displays all users on your current planet. `Access: Everyone`
* **/whois**: Displays user information. Includes player UUID, IP address,
  username, access level, and current planet. `Access: Admin`
* **/promote**: Promotes/demotes a user to a given access level. You can only
  promote if you are a moderator or above, and then only to a user of lesser rank
  than yourself. `Access: Moderator`
* **/kick**: Kicks a user by username. If the name has spaces, enclose it in
  quotes. `Access: Moderator`
* **/ban**: Bans an IP address. Best fetched with /whois. It does not support
  usernames. `Access: Admin`
* **/bans**: Lists all active IP bans. `Access: Admin`
* **/unban**: Unbans an IP address. `Access: Admin`
* **/mute**: Mutes a player. `Access: Moderator`
* **/unmute**: Unmutes a player. `Access: Moderator`
* **/give\_item**: Gives an item to a player. Syntax is /give\_item player
  (enclosed in quotes if it has spaces) itemname count. The default limit for
  number of items to give to a player is 1000. `Access: Admin`

#### Admin Messenger

This command forwards a message to all active moderators or greater. Any command
prefixed with ## will be sent to moderators+ only. `Access: Everyone`

#### Announcer

This plugin simply announces whenever a player joins or quits the server.

#### Bouncer

This plugin prevents non-registered users from building or destroying anything.
It is disabled by default. 

#### Colored names

This plugin displays color codes for each username depending on rank. The colors
are set in config.json.

#### MOTD    

This plugin sends a Message of the Day on login. The MOTD is located in motd.txt
in the plugin folder. It provides the following command:

* **/set\_motd**: Sets the MOTD to the following text. `Access: Moderator`

#### New Player Greeter

Greets first-time players on the server. Gives them a greeting (located in
new\_player\_message.txt) and gives them a pack of starter items (located in
starter\_items.txt). Default items are 200 `coalore` and 5 `alienburger`s. 

#### Planet Protection

This plugin protects specified planets against modification in any way.
Currently if a planet is protected only Admins may modify it. This plugin
provides the following commands:

* **/protect**: Protects the planet you are currently on. `Access: Admin`
* **/unprotect**: Unprotects the planet you are currently on. `Access: Admin`

#### Plugin Manager

This plugin provides a method of enabling/disabling plugins. I know it's silly
that it's a plugin, you don't have to tell me. It provides the following
commands:

* **/list\_plugins**: Sends you a list of all loaded plugins. `Access: Admin`
* **/disable\_plugin**: Disables a plugin by name. `Access: Admin`
* **/enable\_plugin**: Enables a plugin by name. `Access: Admin`
* **/help**: This command provides a list of commands if called by itself, and
  the help string for a command if given a name. Example syntax: /help
  enable\_plugin. `Access: Everyone`

#### Warpy

This plugin provides various methods for warping players and ships around.

* **/warp**: Warps you to another player's ship. `Access: Admin`
* **/move\_ship**: Moves your ship to the location of another player, or
  coordinates in the form of `alpha 514180 -82519336 -23964461 4` `Access: Admin`
* **/move\_other\_ship**: Same as above, but another player's ship. `Access: Admin`

## Plugin development

There are several built-in plugins that you can derive inspiration from. The
plugin API is decidedly simple, and simply responds to packet events. There is a
convenience plugin class called SimpleCommandPlugin which responds to user
commands in chat. Currently there is no easy way to *modify* packets, however
they can be dropped or allowed to send by any plugin intercepting that packet
type.

All plugins must ultimately derive from `BasePlugin`. Do not override the
`__init__` method unless you absolutely know that you need to. All setup
functions should be done in `activate()`

There will be more to come in the near future, for now please examine the base
plugin classes.

Please consider letting us know of your plugin(s) so it can be listed at
[our plugin list](https://github.com/MrMarvin/StarryPy_plugins). Pull requests
are much appreciated! Please note that any plugins that we integrate into
StarryPy proper must be licensed under an open-source license. We suggest the
MIT or BSD licenses. If this isn't acceptable to you, we will only be able to
provide a link.

## Planned features

We haven't been able to pack in everything we've wanted to in this version. We
love contributions, so please feel free to write whatever plugins/improve the
core however you can.

We have quite a roadmap, here are some of the highlights you can expect in the
next major version, and in the development branch before that if you're feeling
brave:

* Spawn networks. Free transportation between admin-designated planets, so your
  new players can get a leg up in the world.
* Loot rolling. So a rare item dropped and you don't think it's fair your friend
  got it? Soon you'll be able to get good items without ending friendships and
  going to prison on the inevitable murder charge.
* Lotteries. Because what is life without a little risk?
* Creature spawning. Want to spawn a couple dozen bone dragons? So do we!
* Projectile blacklist. This should be coming very soon.
* Internationalization. Translate plugins and core messages with ease to your
  preferred language.
* Role based access control Thought the mod/admin/owner distinction is useful,
  having individual roles is our plan for the future.
* Client filtering based on modded items. Though asset digests aren't supported
  right now, we want to do some minor filtering to keep out the riff-raff (if
  you as an admin want to.)
* Plugin dependency overhaul. Really only interesting to developers, but it will
  allow for complex dependency resolution.

There are many more planned features, minor and major. If you have a feature
you'd just love to have that we haven't covered here, put in a feature request
on the issues page.

## Contributing

We're absolutely happy to accept pull requests. There is a freenode channel
called [##starbound-dev](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##starbound-dev)
that we discuss our development on primarily. 

Other than that, please report any bugs you find with the appropriate section of
the debug.log file that is generated.
